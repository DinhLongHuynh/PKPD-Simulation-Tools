# 💊 PKPD-SiAn-Tools 2.0.1
PKPD SiAn Tools - PKPD Simulation and Analysis Tools 2.0.1 is the web application developed by Dinh Long Huynh, a current Master's Student at Uppsala University, Sweden.

This application helps students and researchers to simulate and analyze different scenarios in clinical trials. The underlying mechanism of the simulation and analysis is in the ❓Helps page, with this following link:

In version 2.0.1, the Simulation Tools are reorganized into PK Simulation and Population PK Simulation. The PK Simulation allows a flexible dosing regimen, while the Population PK Simulation is now available for single doses only. This version also uses the generalized API in source code by the package pkpd_sian included in the same Repository.

The ongoing 2.1.0 version will be updated soon, incorporating Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Models.
