# PKPD-SiAn-Tools 1.3.1
PKPD SiAn Tools - PKPD Simulation and Analysis Tools 1.3.1 is the web application developed by Dinh Long Huynh, a current Master's Student at Uppsala University, Sweden.

This application helps students and researchers to simulate and analyze different scenarios in clinical trials. The simulation uses a one-compartmental model and the analysis can be conducted based on both non-compartment and one-compartment models. The underlying mechanism of the simulation and analysis is in the ‚ùìHelps page, with this following link:

In version 1.3.1, all error messages were written as clear instructions so that users could easily fix simulation errors.

The ongoing 1.4.0 version will be updated soon, which incorporates two new features, including automatical data cleaning tools, which help draw several error warnings for the imported data and One-compartmental Analysis for multiple dosing regimens.
