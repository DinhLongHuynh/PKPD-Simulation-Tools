# PKPD-SiAn-Tools
PKPD Simulation Tools 1.0.0 is the web application developed Dinh Long Huynh, a current Master's Student at Uppsala University, Sweden

This application helps students and researchers to simulate different scenarios in clinical trials, using the pharmacokinetic one-compartment model.
         
With the 2.0.0 version, which is an ongoing development, the application will be updated with more features with different compartment models, aiming to accurately simulate clinical scenarios.
