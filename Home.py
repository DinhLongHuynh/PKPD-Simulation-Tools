This application helps students and researchers to simulate and analyze different scenarios in clinical trials. The simulation uses a one-compartmental model and the analysis can be conducted based on both non-compartment and one-compartment models. The underlying mechanism of the simulation and analysis is in the *‚ùìHelps* page. You can click the button below to see the mechanism.""")

Additionally, version 1.2.1 provides demo datasets for the PK Analysis page, which users can use as the app trials. The ongoing 1.3.0 version will be updated soon, which incorporates two new features:
         
1) Automatical data cleaning tools: helps draw several error warnings for the imported data. 
         
2) One-compartmental Analysis for multiple dosing regimen.""")

- **Version 1.0.1:** The Combine Dose Regimen simulation was updated, which enables the simulation of two different dosing regimens.

- **Version 1.1.0:** The PK analysis was introduced, with file importing, characterizing, and data visualization.

             
- **Version 1.1.1:** More optional manipulation of data visualization in PK analysis was updated.

- **Version 1.1.2:** The similarity algorithm to automatically assign the data columns title in PK analysis was introduced.

- **Version 1.2.0:** Non-compartmental and One-compartmental Analyses were introduced.

- **Version 1.2.1:** The PK analysis provided the user with the demo datasets, which can be used as the application trial.''')
